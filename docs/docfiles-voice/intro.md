# EOSCore Voice Documentation

# What is the EOSCore::Voice plugin
The EOSCore Voice plugin is a blueprint wrapper plugin for the EOSVoiceChat plugin that was released with the 4.27 version of Unreal Engine.

It allows you to use the IVoiceInterface in blueprints so that you donâ€™t have to do any c++ in your blueprint projects.
